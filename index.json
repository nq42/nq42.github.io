However, When I needed to back up articles to Notion, all the images were stored as relative paths and could not be displayed correctly. This is why we need an image hosting service.\nDefinition of Image Hosting # Image hosting allows users to upload, store, and share images online. The hosting website stores the images on its server, enabling you to embed images into your websites and blogs, or just share them with others.\nBenefits of Using an Image Hosting Service: # Free storage space:\nStore images on the image hosting service\u0026rsquo;s server and remove them from your own device. Image management:\nOrganize your images in one place to avoid cluttered and reduce the potential impacts of changes. Even if your computer crashes, your images will still be safe. Easy sharing:\nYou do not need to upload your images to Instagram or facebook; you can easily share them with anyone with your permission. Load speed:\nImprove website speed by delivering images more efficiently, which can also enhance SEO. Image Hosting Service # There are many image hosting websites, offering both free and paid options. You can also purchase a VPS to build your own personal image hosting service.\nThe bandwidth and storage requirements for personal use are typically modest. Here I use Cloudflare R2. Cloudflare R2 is an S3-compatible, zero egress-fee, object storage. The free storage plan is 10 GB / month, which meets my needs. Here is the pricing list.\nCreate Cloudflare R2 # Login your cloudflare account, find R2 Object Storage on the left side, and activate the R2 service. Then click create bucket button.\nFill in the bucket name as you wish, choose the location, or simply use the automatic location if you do not have sepecial requirements. Then click create bucket button.\nNow we can upload images into this bucket.\nCustom Domain # The default domain of the bucket is random and not easy to remember. A Custom domain is available. Note that when a custom domain is connected to your bucket, the contents of your bucket will be made publicly accessible through that domain.\nClick the settings of your bucket, input your registered domain or subdomain, connect the domain, and wait for the DNS to take effect.\nWhen the configuration is finished, go back to your bucket\u0026rsquo;s uploading page, upload the image and, check the details.\nNow You can use the URL to access this image.\nCover image: star-forming nebula W51, one of the largest \u0026ldquo;star factories\u0026rdquo; in the Milky Way galaxy.

Normally, the theme documentation will give details about its installation and configuration.\nInstall using git\nEnsure you have Git installed on your local machine. Change into the directory for your Hugo website (that you created above), initialize a new git repository, and add your chosen theme as a submodule. Here we use the theme blowfish as an example.\ncd your-site-name git init git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish Install manually\nDownload the latest release of the theme source code from GitHub, extract the archive, rename the folder to the name of the theme (blowfish here), and move it to the themes/ directory inside your Hugo project’s root folder.\nNormally there is an exampleSite folder inside your themes/YourChosenTheme, which is a demo site of your chosen theme. You can copy this folder to your site folder, then do the configuration based on this example site. Check the configuration docs provided by the theme for more details. Remember to change the baseURL and chosen theme name in Hugo.toml.\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;https://\u0026lt;yourname\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026#34; # the URL of your GitHub Pages repo.

You can publish this static Website to your hosting server.\nhugo In order to build and publish the website automatically, we will use GitHub Pages and GitHub Action later.\nCreate GitHub repositories # Two repositories need to be created here. One is the source code repo, another is GitHub Pages repo.\nGitHub repo for source code\nThis repo can be private. You can make any name for this repo.\nUpload your local project to this repo:\ncd your-site-name git init git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;first commit\u0026#34; git branch -M main git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/myblog.git git push -u origin main GitHub pages repo\nThis repo is used to host the static HTML files (the files in the public folder generated by hugo command). The repo name must be \u0026lt;yourname\u0026gt;.github.io. \u0026lt;yourname\u0026gt; is the user name of your GitHub account. It must be public.

Go to your GitHub account: Settings-Developer settings-personal access tokens, Create a Token here. Notice the name of the token should be the same as personal_token in gh-pages.yml above:\nCopy this generated Token (only show once), and go to your source code repo Settings - Secrets and variables - Actions-New repository secret:\nWhen finish all these configurations, push your code to your source code repo. It will trigger GitHub Action, generate the static websites, and push to your GitHub Pages repo automatically.\nThe update of GitHub Pages repo will trigger the CI deployment automatically. After 1-2 mins, you can check your website via https://\u0026lt;yourname\u0026gt;.github.io.\nSet up a custom domain # You can use your own domain for this GitHub Pages website.\nChange the baseURL to your own domain in Hugo.toml.\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;https://www.your-domain.com/\u0026#34; Change the URL in the GitHub Pages Repo, Settings - Pages\nNow, go to your domain host to configure DNS. Here I use Cloudflare as example. Add one CNAME record pointed to your GitHub Pages repo.\nThen go to Page Rules to add one rule for redirect. Page Rules - Create Page Rule:\nTill now everything is done. After you update your code, wait for several mins, you can visit your website via your own domain.\nIn addition, if you want to integrate a contact form, please read:\n","date":"7 September 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tech/3-create-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-hugo/","section":"Tech","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eWhat is Hugo \n    \u003cdiv id=\"what-is-hugo\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#what-is-hugo\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, Hugo sites can be hosted anywhere, including Netlify, Heroku, GoDaddy, DreamHost, GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Surge, Firebase, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Rackspace, Azure, and CloudFront and work well with CDNs.
